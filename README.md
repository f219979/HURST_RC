# HURST_RD: The code presented here is part of a PhD research developed by me and my advisor. Our research forecasts financial time series using a machine learning model called Reservoir Computation. We compute the Hurst exponents for each 100-day trading window with one step ahead, forming a set with j Hurst exponents. We concatenate this data with the normalized data of the original time series and feed this concatenated data to our forecasting model, and thus make the desired predictions.
