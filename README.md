# HURST_RC: THE CODE PRESENTED HERE IS PART OF A DOCTORAL RESEARCH DEVELOPED BY ME AND MY ADVISOR. OUR RESEARCH MAKES FORECASTS OF FINANCIAL TIME SERIES USING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL CALLED RESERVOIR COMPUTATION. WE CALCULATE HURST EXPONENTS OVER EACH 100-DAY TRADING DAY SLIDING WINDOW WITH ONE STEP AHEAD FORMING A SET WITH J HURST EXPONENTS, THEN CONCATENATE THIS DATA WITH THE NORMALIZED ORIGINAL TIME SERIES DATA, THEN FEED OUR FORECASTING MODEL WITH THIS CONCATENATED DATA, AND THEN MAKE THE DESIRED FORECASTS.
